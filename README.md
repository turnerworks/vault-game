## Project Overview

**The Vault Game** is a constraint-based meta-game concept where players enter a vault with a fixed loadout of tools/powers. Once inside, the vault door closes and your choices are locked - you can only work with what you brought.

### Core Mechanics

- **Fixed Loadout System:** Choose your tools before entry - no changes after
- **Time Pressure:** Race against the clock with your chosen constraints
- **Multi-Player Competition:** Compete in like-for-like scenarios
- **Strategic Depth:** Success depends on preparation and resource management
- **Meta Commentary:** The game explores themes of constraint, choice, and consequence
